In our examples so far, we've already seen many of the  built-in Python data structures in action. You've probably also covered  many of them in introductory books or tutorials. In this chapter, we'll  discuss the object-oriented features of these data structures, when they  should be used instead of a regular class, and when they should not be  used. In particular, we'll be covering the following topics:

- Tuples and named tuples
- Dataclasses
- Dictionaries
- Lists and sets
- How and why to extend built-in objects
- Three types of queues
