In previous lessons, we've covered many of the defining features of  object-oriented programming. We now know the principles and paradigms of  object-oriented design, and we've covered the syntax of object-oriented  programming in Python.

Yet, we don't know exactly how and,  especially, when to utilize these principles and syntax in practice. In  this chapter, we'll discuss some useful applications of the knowledge  we've gained, looking at some new topics along the way:

- How to recognize objects
- Data and behaviors, once again
- Wrapping data behaviors using properties
- Restricting data using behaviors
- The Don't Repeat Yourself principle
- Recognizing repeated code
