Throughout this course, we've focused on the separation  of behavior and data. This is very important in object-oriented  programming, but we're about to see that, in Python, the distinction is  uncannily blurry. Python is very good at blurring distinctions; it  doesn't exactly help us to **think outside the box**. Rather, it teaches us to stop thinking about the box.

Before  we get into the details, let's discuss some bad object-oriented theory.  Many object-oriented languages teach us to never access attributes  directly (Java is the most notorious). They insist that we write  attribute access like this:

```python
class Color: 
    def __init__(self, rgb_value, name): 
        self._rgb_value = rgb_value 
        self._name = name 
 
    def set_name(self, name): 
        self._name = name 
     
    def get_name(self): 
        return self._name 
```

The variables are  prefixed with an underscore to suggest that they are private (other  languages would actually force them to be private). Then, the `get` and `set` methods provide access to each variable. This class would be used in practice as follows:

```python
>>> c = Color("#ff0000", "bright red")>>> c.get_name()'bright red'>>> c.set_name("red")>>> c.get_name()'red'
```

This is not nearly as readable as the direct access version that Python favors:

```python
class Color: 
    def __init__(self, rgb_value, name): 
        self.rgb_value = rgb_value 
        self.name = name 
 
c = Color("#ff0000", "bright red") 
print(c.name) 
c.name = "red"
print(c.name)
```

So, why would anyone insist upon the method-based syntax? Their  reasoning is that, someday, we may want to add extra code when a value  is set or retrieved. For example, we could decide to cache a value to  avoid complex computations, or we might want to validate that a given  value is a suitable input.

In code, for example, we could decide to change the `set_name()` method as follows:

```python
def set_name(self, name): 
    if not name: 
        raise Exception("Invalid Name") 
    self._name = name 
```

Now, in Java and similar  languages, if we had written our original code for direct attribute  access, and then later changed it to a method like the preceding one,  we'd have a problem: anyone who had written code that accessed the  attribute directly would now have to access a method. If they didn't  then change the access style from attribute access to a function call,  their code will be broken.

The mantra in these languages is that  we should never make public members private. This doesn't make much  sense in Python since there isn't any real concept of private members!

Python gives us the `property` keyword to make methods that **look** like attributes. We can therefore write our code to use direct  member access, and if we ever unexpectedly need to alter the  implementation to do some calculation when getting or setting that  attribute's value, we can do so without changing the interface. Let's  see how it looks:

```python
class Color: 
    def __init__(self, rgb_value, name): 
        self.rgb_value = rgb_value 
        self._name = name 
 
    def _set_name(self, name): 
        if not name: 
            raise Exception("Invalid Name") 
        self._name = name 
 
    def _get_name(self): 
        return self._name 
 
    name = property(_get_name, _set_name)
```

Compared to the earlier class, we first change the `name` attribute into a (semi-)private `_name` attribute. Then, we add two more (semi-)private methods to get and set that variable, performing our validation when we set it.

Finally, we have the `property` declaration at the bottom. This is the Python magic. It creates a new attribute on the `Color` class called `name`, to replace the direct `name` attribute. It sets this attribute to be a **property**. Under the hood, `property` calls the two methods we just created whenever the value is accessed or changed. This new version of the `Color` class can be used exactly the same way as the earlier version, yet it now performs validation when we set the `name` attribute:

```python
>>> c = Color("#0000ff", "bright red")>>> print(c.name)bright red>>> c.name = "red">>> print(c.name)red>>> c.name = ""Traceback (most recent call last):  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>  File "setting_name_property.py", line 8, in _set_name    raise Exception("Invalid Name")Exception: Invalid Name
```

So, if we'd previously written code to access the `name` attribute, and then changed it to use our `property`-based object, the previous code would still work, unless it was sending an empty `property` value, which is the behavior we wanted to forbid in the first place. Success!

Bear in mind that, even with the `name` property, the previous code is not 100% safe. People can still access the `_name`  attribute directly and set it to an empty string if they want to. But  if they access a variable we've explicitly marked with an underscore to suggest it is private, they're the ones that have to deal with the consequences, not us.

# Properties in Detail

Think of the `property` function as returning an object that proxies any requests to set or access the attribute value through the methods we have specified. The `property` built-in is like a constructor for such an object, and that object is set as the public-facing member for the given attribute.

This `property` constructor can actually accept two additional arguments, a `delete` function and a docstring for the property. The `delete`  function is rarely supplied in practice, but it can be useful for  logging the fact that a value has been deleted, or possibly to veto  deleting if we have reason to do so. The docstring is just a string  describing what the property does, no different from the docstrings we  discussed in **Objects in Python**. If we do not supply this parameter, the docstring will instead be copied from the docstring for the first argument: the `getter` method. Here is a silly example that states whenever any of the methods are called:

```python
class Silly:
    def _get_silly(self):
        print("You are getting silly")
        return self._silly

    def _set_silly(self, value):
        print("You are making silly {}".format(value))
        self._silly = value

    def _del_silly(self):
        print("Whoah, you killed silly!")
        del self._silly

    silly = property(_get_silly, _set_silly, _del_silly, "This is a silly property")
```

If we actually use this class, it does indeed print out the correct strings when we ask it to:

```python
>>> s = Silly()>>> s.silly = "funny"You are making silly funny>>> s.sillyYou are getting silly'funny'>>> del s.sillyWhoah, you killed silly!
```

Further, if we look at the help file for the `Silly` class (by issuing `help(Silly)` at the interpreter prompt), it shows us the custom docstring for our `silly` attribute:

```python
Help on class Silly in module __main__: 
 
class Silly(builtins.object) 
 |  Data descriptors defined here: 
 |   
 |  __dict__ 
 |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined) 
 |   
 |  __weakref__ 
 |      list of weak references to the object (if defined) 
 |   
 |  silly 
 |      This is a silly property
```

Once  again, everything is working as we planned. In practice, properties are  normally only defined with the first two parameters: the `getter` and `setter` functions. If we want to supply a docstring for a property, we can define it on the `getter` function; the property proxy will copy it into its own docstring. The `delete`  function is often left empty because object attributes are so rarely  deleted. If a coder does try to delete a property that doesn't have a `delete`  function specified, it will raise an exception. Therefore, if there is a  legitimate reason to delete our property, we should supply that  function.

# Decorators â€“ Another Way to Create Properties

If  you've never used Python decorators before, you might want to skip this  section and come back to it after we've discussed the decorator pattern  in **Python Design Patterns I**. However, you don't need to understand what's going on to use the decorator syntax in order to make property methods more readable.

The `property` function can be used with the decorator syntax to turn a `get` function into a `property` function, as follows:

```python
class Foo: 
    @property 
    def foo(self): 
        return "bar" 
```

This applies the `property` function as a decorator, and is equivalent to the previous `foo = property(foo)` syntax. The main difference, from a readability perspective, is that we get to mark the `foo`  function as a property at the top of the method, instead of after it is  defined, where it can be easily overlooked. It also means we don't have  to create private methods with underscore prefixes just to define a  property.

Going one step further, we can specify a `setter` function for the new property as follows:

```python
class Foo: 
    @property 
    def foo(self): 
        return self._foo 
 
    @foo.setter 
    def foo(self, value): 
        self._foo = value 
```

This syntax looks pretty odd, although the intent is obvious. First, we decorate the `foo` method as a getter. Then, we decorate a second method with exactly the same name by applying the `setter` attribute of the originally decorated `foo` method! The `property` function returns an object; this object always comes with its own `setter`  attribute, which can then be applied as a decorator to other functions.  Using the same name for the get and set methods is not required, but it  does help to group together the multiple methods that access one  property.

We can also specify a `delete` function with `@foo.deleter`. We cannot specify a docstring using `property` decorators, so we need to rely on the property copying the docstring from the initial getter method. Here's our previous `Silly` class rewritten to use `property` as a decorator:

```python
class Silly: 
    @property 
    def silly(self): 
        "This is a silly property" 
        print("You are getting silly") 
        return self._silly 
 
    @silly.setter 
    def silly(self, value): 
        print("You are making silly {}".format(value)) 
        self._silly = value 
 
    @silly.deleter 
    def silly(self): 
        print("Whoah, you killed silly!") 
        del self._silly 
```

This class operates *exactly* the same as our earlier version, including the help text. You can use whichever syntax you feel is more readable and elegant.

# Deciding When to Use Properties

With the built-in property clouding the division  between behavior and data, it can be confusing to know when to choose  an attribute, or a method, or a property. The use case example we saw  earlier is one of the most common uses of properties; we have some data  on a class that we later want to add behavior to. There are also other  factors to take into account when deciding to use a property.

Technically,  in Python, data, properties, and methods are all attributes on a class.  The fact that a method is callable does not distinguish it from other  types of attributes; indeed, we'll see in [**Python Object-Oriented Shortcuts**,  that it is possible to create normal objects that can be called like  functions. We'll also discover that functions and methods are themselves  normal objects.

The fact that methods are just callable  attributes, and properties are just customizable attributes, can help us  make this decision. Methods should typically represent actions; things  that can be done to, or performed by, the object. When you call a  method, even with only one argument, it should *do* something. Method names are generally verbs.

Once  confirming that an attribute is not an action, we need to decide  between standard data attributes and properties. In general, always use a  standard attribute until you need to control access to that property in  some way. In either case, your attribute is usually a noun. The only  difference between an attribute and a property is that we can invoke  custom actions automatically when a property is retrieved, set, or  deleted.

Let's look at a more realistic example. A common  need for custom behavior is caching a value that is difficult to  calculate or expensive to look up (requiring, for example, a network  request or database query). The goal is to store the value locally to  avoid repeated calls to the expensive calculation.

We can do this  with a custom getter on the property. The first time the value is  retrieved, we perform the lookup or calculation. Then, we can locally  cache the value as a private attribute on our object (or in dedicated  caching software), and the next time the value is requested, we return  the stored data. Here's how we might cache a web page:

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen


class WebPage:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
        self._content = None

    @property
 def content(self):
 if not self._content:
 print("Retrieving New Page...")
 self._content = urlopen(self.url).read()
 return self._content
```

We can test this code to see that the page is only retrieved once:

```python
>>> import time>>> webpage = WebPage("http://ccphillips.net/")>>> now = time.time()>>> content1 = webpage.contentRetrieving New Page...>>> time.time() - now22.43316888809204>>> now = time.time()>>> content2 = webpage.content>>> time.time() - now1.9266459941864014>>> content2 == content1True
```

I  was on an awful satellite connection when I originally tested this code  for the first version of this book back in 2010 and it took 20 seconds  the first time I loaded  the content. The second time, I got the result in 2 seconds (which is  really just the amount of time it took to type the lines into the  interpreter). On my more modern connection it looks as follows:

```python
>>> webpage = WebPage("https://dusty.phillips.codes")
>>> import time
>>> now = time.time() ; content1 = webpage.content ; print(time.time() - now)
Retrieving New Page...
0.6236202716827393
>>> now = time.time() ; content2 = webpage.content ; print(time.time() - now)
1.7881393432617188e-05M
```

It takes about 620 milliseconds to retrieve a page from my web host. From my laptop's RAM, it takes 0.018 milliseconds!

Custom  getters are also useful for attributes that need to be calculated on  the fly, based on other object attributes. For example, we might want to  calculate the average for a list of integers:

```python
class AverageList(list): 
    @property 
    def average(self): 
        return sum(self) / len(self) 
```

This very simple class inherits from `list`,  so we get list-like behavior for free. We just add a property to the  class, and hey presto, our list can have an average as follows:

```python
>>> a = AverageList([1,2,3,4])>>> a.average2.5
```

Of course, we could have made this a method instead, but then we ought to call it `calculate_average()`, since methods represent actions. But a property called `average` is more suitable, and is both easier to type and easier to read.

Custom  setters are useful for validation, as we've already seen, but they can  also be used to proxy a value to another location. For example, we could  add a content setter to the `WebPage` class that automatically logs into our web server and uploads a new page whenever the value is set.
