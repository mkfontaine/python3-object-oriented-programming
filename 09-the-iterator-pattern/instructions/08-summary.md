In this lesson, we learned that design patterns are useful  abstractions that provide best-practice solutions for common programming  problems. We covered our first design pattern, the iterator, as well as  numerous ways that Python uses and abuses this pattern for its own  nefarious purposes. The original iterator pattern is extremely  object-oriented, but it is also rather ugly and verbose to code around.  However, Python's built-in syntax abstracts the ugliness away, leaving  us with a clean interface to these object-oriented constructs.

Comprehensions  and generator expressions can combine container construction with  iteration in a single line. Generator objects can be constructed using  the `yield` syntax. Coroutines look like generators on the outside but serve a much different purpose.

We'll cover several more design patterns in the next two lessons.
