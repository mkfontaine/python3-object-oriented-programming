We've discussedhow many of Python's built-ins and idioms seem, at first blush,  to fly in the face of object-oriented principles, but are actually  providing access to real objects under the hood. In this chapter, we'll  discuss how the `for` loop, which seems so  structured, is actually a lightweight wrapper around a set of  object-oriented principles. We'll also see a variety of extensions to  this syntax that automatically create even more types of object. We will  cover the following topics:

- What design patterns are
- The iterator protocolâ€”one of the most powerful design patterns
- List, set, and dictionary comprehensions
- Generators and coroutines
