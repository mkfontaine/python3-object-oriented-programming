We have finally covered the most important topic in Python  programming: automated testing. Test-driven development is considered a  best practice. The standard library `unittest` module provides a great out-of-the-box solution for testing, while the `pytest`  framework has some more Pythonic syntaxes. Mocks can be used to emulate  complex classes in our tests. Code coverage gives us an estimate of how  much of our code is being run by our tests, but it does not tell us  that we have tested the right things.

In the next lesson, we'll jump into a completely different topic: concurrency.
