Skilled Python programmers agree that  testing is one of the most important aspects of software development.  Even though this lesson is placed near the end of the course, it is not  an afterthought; everything we have studied so far will help us when  writing tests. In this lesson, we'll look at the following topics:

- The importance of unit testing and test-driven development
- The standard `unittest` module
- The `pytest` automated testing suite
- The `mock` module
- Code coverage
- Cross-platform testing with `tox`
