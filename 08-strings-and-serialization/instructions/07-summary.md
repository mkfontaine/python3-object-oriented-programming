We've covered string manipulation, regular expressions, and object  serialization in this chapter. Hardcoded strings and program variables  can be combined into outputtable strings using the powerful string  formatting system. It is important to distinguish between binary and  textual data, and `bytes` and `str` have specific purposes that must be understood. Both are immutable, but the `bytearray` type can be used when manipulating bytes.

Regular expressions are a complex topic, and we only scratched the surface. There are many ways to serialize Python data; pickles and JSON are two of the most popular.

In  the next lesson, we'll look at a design pattern that is so fundamental  to Python programming that it has been given special syntax support:  the iterator pattern.
