We covered a grab bag of topics in this lesson. Each represented an  important non-object-oriented feature that is popular in Python. Just  because we can use object-oriented principles does not always mean we  should!

However, we also saw that Python typically implements such  features by providing a syntax shortcut to traditional object-oriented  syntax. Knowing the object-oriented principles underlying these tools  allows us to use them more effectively in our own classes.

We  discussed a series of built-in functions and file I/O operations. There  are a whole bunch of different syntaxes available to us when calling  functions with arguments, keyword arguments, and variable argument  lists. Context managers are useful for the common pattern of sandwiching  a piece of code between two method calls. Even functions are objects,  and, conversely, any normal object can be made callable.

In the  next lesson, we'll learn more about string and file manipulation, and  even spend some time with one of the least object-oriented topics in the  standard library: regular expressions.
