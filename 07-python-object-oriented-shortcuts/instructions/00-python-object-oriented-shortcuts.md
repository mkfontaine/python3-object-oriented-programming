There are many aspects of Python that  appear more reminiscent of structural or functional programming than  object-oriented programming. Although object-oriented programming has  been the most visible paradigm of the past two decades, the old models  have seen a recent resurgence. As with Python's data structures, most of  these tools are syntactic sugar over an underlying object-oriented  implementation; we can think of them as a further abstraction layer  built on top of the (already abstracted) object-oriented paradigm. In  this chapter, we'll be covering a grab bag of Python features that are  not strictly object-oriented:

- Built-in functions that take care of common tasks in one call
- File I/O and context managers
- An alternative to method overloading
- Functions as objects
