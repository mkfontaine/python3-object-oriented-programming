In the previous lesson, we were briefly  introduced to design patterns, and covered the iterator pattern, a  pattern so useful and common that it has been abstracted into the core  of the programming language itself. In this chapter, we'll be reviewing  other common patterns, and how they are implemented in Python. As with  iteration, Python often provides an alternative syntax to make working  with such problems simpler. We will cover both the **traditional** design, and the Python version for these patterns.

In summary, we'll see:

- Numerous specific patterns
- A canonical implementation of each pattern in Python
- Python syntax to replace certain patterns
