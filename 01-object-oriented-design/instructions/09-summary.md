In this lesson, we took a whirlwind tour through the terminology of  the object-oriented paradigm, focusing on object-oriented design. We can  separate different objects into a taxonomy of different classes and  describe the attributes and behaviors of those objects via the class  interface. Abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding are highly-related concepts.  There are many different kinds of relationships between objects,  including association, composition, and inheritance. UML syntax can be  useful for fun and communication.

In the next lesson, we'll explore how to implement classes and methods in Python.
