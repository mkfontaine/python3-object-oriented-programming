In the programming world, duplicate code is considered evil. We  should not have multiple copies of the same, or similar, code in  different places.

There are many ways to merge pieces of code or  objects that have a similar functionality. In this chapter, we'll be  covering the most famous object-oriented principle: inheritance. As  discussed in **Object-Oriented Design**, inheritance allows us to create is a relationships  between two or more classes, abstracting common logic into superclasses  and managing specific details in the subclass. In particular, we'll be  covering the Python syntax and principles for the following:

- Basic inheritance
- Inheriting from built-in types
- Multiple inheritance
- Polymorphism and duck typing
