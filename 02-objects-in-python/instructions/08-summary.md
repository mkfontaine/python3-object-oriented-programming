In this lesson, we learned how simple it is to create classes and  assign properties and methods in Python. Unlike many languages, Python  differentiates between a constructor and an initializer. It has a  relaxed attitude toward access control. There are many different levels  of scope, including packages, modules, classes, and functions. We  understood the difference between relative and absolute imports, and how  to manage third-party packages that don't come with Python.

In the next lesson, we'll learn how to share implementation using inheritance.
