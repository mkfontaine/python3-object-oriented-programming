So, we now have a design in hand and are ready to turn that design  into a working program! Of course, it doesn't usually happen this way.  We'll be seeing examples and hints for good software design throughout  the book, but our focus is object-oriented programming. So, let's have a  look at the Python syntax that allows us to create object-oriented  software.

After completing this lesson, we will understand the following:

- How to create classes and instantiate objects in Python
- How to add attributes and behaviors to Python objects
- How to organize classes into packages and modules
- How to suggest that people don't clobber our data
